# Send 
Our digital remittance app uplifts the unbanked community. Foreign workers can securely remit money back home using stablecoins, while ensuring that recipients back home can spend seamlessly in fiat currency. Cross-border transactions typically takes days and incurs hefty transaction fees, which is a huge toll on low-income households to maintain bank accounts. It becomes a self-reinforcing cycle of their not being able to save as they canâ€™t fulfill their maintenance fees, which leads to their being unable to save and grow their wealth.

Send, our one-stop remittance app, is built with Flutter and powered by the Solana blockchain. Cross-border transactions with our platform is swift, secure and seamless, allowing our users to cut through all financial intermediaries and save on unnecessary fees.
